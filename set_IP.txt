sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interface.backup
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces



To use DHCP services, change the line to:
iface eth0 inet dhcp
To use static IP settings, change the line to:
iface eth0 inet static


For static IP settings, add lines for address, netmask, and gateway. For example:
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.2
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
